THIS IS MY VERSION OF THE PACMAN GAME MADE IN JAVA.
TO START THE GAME, JUST EXTRACT THE pacman.rar FILE AND IMPORT THE CODE INTO YOUR PROGRAM.

THE GAME INCLUDES:

3 DIFFERENT CUSTOM MAPS
SMOOTH PLAYER MOVEMENT AND COLLISION DETECTION
GHOSTS WITH CHASING MECHANICS
POINT SYSTEM AND HIGH SCORE TRACKING
SIMPLE PIXEL BUT ENGAGING GRAPHICS

GAME MECHANICS:

WHEN ALL FOOD IS EATEN, THE PLAYER ADVANCES TO THE NEXT LEVEL
IF THE PLAYER EATS A HEART THAT RANDOMLY SPAWNS ON THE MAP, THEY GAIN +1 EXTRA LIFE
IF THE PLAYER EATS AN EXTRA-SPAWNED FOOD (PEPPER, HOT COFFEE, OR BEER), PAC-MAN TURNS RED AND CAN EAT GHOSTS FOR A SHORT TIME
IF PAC-MAN EXITS THE MAP BOUNDARY ON ONE SIDE, HE WILL REAPPEAR ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE

CONTROLS:

MOVE WITH W, A, S, D OR ARROW KEYS
PAUSE THE GAME WITH P
RESTART THE GAME WITH R

P.S. The game is still not fully completed, but in future updates, I plan to add: sound effects, background music, a two-player mode, more new maps, and fix minor bugs.

Enjoy the game and have fun playing! ðŸŽ®
